    "This implementation showcases a reflex agent navigating a grid environment. The agent can move in only two directions (left and right) and aims to clean dirty cells within a grid. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: The `Agent` is initialized with its location and the status of its current cell (dirty or clean). This setup allows the agent to react based on its immediate environment.\n",
    "- **Perception**: Through the `percept` method, the agent perceives its environment. If the current cell is dirty, it decides to clean; otherwise, it chooses to move.\n",
    "- **Action**: Actions are determined based on the agent's perception. If the cell is dirty, it performs a \"Suck\" action to clean. If the cell is clean, it randomly chooses a direction to move based on available movements.\n",
    "- **Randomized Movement**: When deciding to move, the agent randomly selects between predefined movements (left or right in this implementation), illustrating a simple decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Initialization**: The environment is initialized with a predefined state, indicating which cells are dirty or clean. It also defines the possible movements for the agent.\n",
    "- **Simulation Steps**: The environment runs a simulation for a specified number of steps, during which the agent acts based on its perception of the current state.\n",
    "- **Action Effects**: The environment updates its state based on the agent's actions. If the agent cleans a cell, the cell's status is updated to clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: This implementation focuses on the basic functionalities of a reflex agent, reacting to immediate perceptions with predefined actions.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: While the agent currently only reacts to the cleanliness of its location, the framework allows for easy expansion to more complex scenarios and additional actions.\n",
    "- **Randomness in Action**: The inclusion of random choice in movement represents a simple way to simulate decision-making in a limited environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple reflex agent demonstrates the core principles of reactive AI systems. By interacting with its environment based on direct perceptions, the agent showcases basic decision-making capabilities. While this model is simplistic, it provides a foundation for understanding more complex agent behaviors and the design of AI systems that can adapt to and manipulate their environments."

    "- **Valid Moves**: The `is_valid_move` method checks if a proposed move is within the grid bounds and not into a wall.\n",
    "- **Action**: The `action` method decides the agent's action. If the current location is dirty, it cleans (sucks the dirt) and gains points. Otherwise, it moves in a random direction and incurs a small penalty for moving or a larger penalty for attempting to move through a wall.\n",
    "- **Score**: Points are awarded for cleaning and deducted for moving, especially into walls, reflecting the agent's efficiency.\n",

    "### Environment\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflex Agent**: The agent reacts to the immediate state of the environment (i.e., whether the current cell is dirty or clean) without memory of past states or consideration of future consequences.\n",
    "- **Environment Interactions**: The agent and environment interact closely, with the agent's actions directly modifying the environment (cleaning dirt) and its own state (changing location and score).\n",
    "- **Randomness**: The agent's movement (when not cleaning) is random, introducing unpredictability in its path and effectiveness.\n",
    "- **Performance Measurement**: The agent's performance is quantified through its score, incentivizing cleaning dirt over aimless movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflex agent demonstrates basic AI principles in a controlled environment, emphasizing reactive behaviors over planning or strategy. Its simplicity makes it a useful model for understanding how agents perceive and act within their environments, although its effectiveness is limited by the lack of foresight and adaptability."
