# Simple Reflex Agents

Welcome to the Simple Reflex Agents GitHub repository! In this repository, you'll find code and resources related to simple reflex agents, a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence and agent-based systems.

## What are Simple Reflex Agents?

Simple reflex agents are a type of artificial intelligence agent that operates based on a simple set of rules, without any internal memory or ability to plan ahead. These agents perceive their environment through sensors, apply predefined rules or condition-action pairs to determine their actions, and act accordingly to achieve their goals.

## Repository Contents

### `SimpleReflexAgent.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of a simple reflex agent. The agent perceives its environment, analyzes the current state, and selects actions based on predefined rules; facilitated via the `Agent` class.

The `Environement` class provides a simple environment in which the agent operates. It includes functions to simulate the environment, update the agent's perception, and provide feedback based on the agent's actions.

### `README.md`

You're currently reading the README file! It provides an overview of the repository, instructions for running the code, and additional resources for understanding simple reflex agents.
